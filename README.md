# excel-crowdfunding-spreadsheet

Hello! This repository contains my code for Module 1 of Rice University's Data Analytics & Visualization bootcamp. 

For this challenge, we organized and examined data from approximately 1,000 crowdfunded startup companies to uncover trends in their success or failure. All work is contained in the crowdfunding Excel file on the main branch.

The work contained in this repository is my original work. 

Thank you!
